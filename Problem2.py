#Describe the Distribution of Survivors after a 5 year period.

#The probability of 5 year survival follows a binomial distribution because death
#follows a discrete (Bernoulli) process. #k is the number of successes (aka deaths)
# n is the number of years
# and p is the mortality probality in a given year.
